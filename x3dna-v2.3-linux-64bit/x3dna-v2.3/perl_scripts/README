This directory contains Perl scripts from previous versions (v2.0 and
v1.5) of 3DNA. As of v2.1, we have switched from Perl to Ruby as the
script language. Some functionalities from the original Perl scripts
are now consolidated into the Ruby script 'x3dna_utils'. The new Ruby
script 'x3dna_ensemble' is for analyzing NMR ensembles or trajectories
of molecular dynamics simulations.

The original Perl scripts are kept here for back reference only --
I'll correct bugs as they are identified, but no more new features.
