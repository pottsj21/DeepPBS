The 'simple' base-pair and step parameters were introduced into 3DNA as of
v2.3-2016jan01. This list of 'simple' parameters is reported by default,
but can be turned off by specifying 'analyze -simple=false'.

The simple parameters are 'intuitive' for non-Watson-Crick base pairs and
associated base-pair steps, where the above corresponding 3DNA parameters
may appear cryptic. Note that the following sets of simple parameters are
for structural description only, not to be fed into the 'rebuild' program.
Overall, they complement the rigorous characterization of base-pair
geometry, as exemplified by the original 3DNA analyze/rebuild programs.

In short, the 'simple' base-pair parameters employ the RC8--YC6 (default,
or RN9--YN1) vector as the (long) y-axis of the pair. As before, the
z-axis is the average of two base normals, taking consideration of the M-N
vs M+N base-pair classification. In essence, the 'simple' parameters make
geometrical sense through the introduction of an ad hoc base-pair
reference frame in each case. See x3dna.org for more details. The same
idea applies to the 'simple' inter-base-pair step parameters, which use
consecutive C1'--C1' vectors.

Here, 'angle' refers to the inter-base angle of each pair, with values in
the range of [0, 90] degrees corresponding to the net non-planarity, i.e.,
sqrt(buckle^2 + propeller^2).
