   In p.56 Figs. (c) and (d), the 36 degrees twist angle is helical twist,
   which corresponds ~34 degrees of step twist angle as given in CEHS. For
   Figs. (a) and (b) the two twists are identical.

   p56figab/p56figcd are two short shell scripts for getting Figs.
      (a)/(b) and (c)/(d) in EPS, XFIG and Raster3D formats. The four
      structures were set with reference to the middle helical frame
      defined by rectangular blocks #1 and #11. Figs. (c) and (d) have
      a small rotation about z-axis to make the helical axis vertical.

   p78fig is a script similar to p56fig. The four structures were set with
   reference to the middle frame defined by blocks #11 and #12.

The script 'get_all' combines all the above functionality into one.
