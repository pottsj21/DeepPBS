[1] Four sets of PDB files are given here to illustrate the analysis procedure:
    2d94  --- an A-DNA 8-mer
    355d  --- a B-DNA 12-mer
    1aoi  --- a nucleosomal DNA structure, with 146 base pairs
    1tc3 --- a DNA-protein complex with an A-/B-DNA junction

    The *.inp files for each of the DNA structure were generated with
    "find_pair". Using 355d.pdb as an example:
                       find_pair 355d.pdb 355d.inp

    With "355d.inp" in hand, run "analyze" on it to get various parameters:
                               analyze 355d.inp

    The above two steps can be combined:
                    find_pair 355d.pdb stdout | analyze stdin

    The four structures can be analyzed simultaneously as below:
              analyze 2d94.inp 355d.inp 1aoi.inp 1tc3.inp

    In addition to the main output file (*.out), each run of "analyze"
    also generates a serial of other files with fixed names (e.g.,
    bp_step.par, stacking.pdb etc). Each time "analyze" is executed,
    these files are over-written unless renamed.
 
[2] Rebuilding with the sugar-phosphate backbone
    The rebuilding of a DNA structure relies on its base sequence and
    associated base-pair and step parameters, plus a set of standard
    Atomic_?.pdb data files.
    
    The rebuilding algorithm is rigorous as far as the base geometry
    is concerned. However, as shown below, one can build a full atomic
    DNA/RNA structure with an approximate sugar-phosphate backbone.
    Moreover, the rough backbone linkage can be optimized with phenix
    while keeping base atoms fixed.

    In directory $X3DNA/config/atomic/, there are 4 sets of standard
    PDB files, corresponding to A-DNA (C3'-endo sugar), B-DNA
    (C2'-endo), RNA (C3'-endo plus O2') and NDB96 (default, with no
    backbone atoms). The base geometry is consistent throughout.

    To use a set other than the default, simply copy these files to
    over-write their Atomic_?.pdb counterparts; i.e., BDNA_A.pdb to
    Atomic_A.pdb. This process is automated by script 'x3dna_utils':
                       x3dna_utils cp_std BDNA

    The above command puts the B-DNA set into your current directory
    (as in this directory). See the corresponding FAQ on the Forum.

    To rebuild 355d with a standard B-DNA sugar-phosphate backbone:
             find_pair 355d.pdb stdout | analyze stdin

    The resultant file "bp_step.par" contains base sequence and step
    parameters. (Another file, "bp_helical.par", which contains
    helical parameters, can also be used for the following rebuilding
    process.)
                 rebuild -atomic bp_step.par temp.pdb

    Use Jmol/PyMOL to have a look of "temp.pdb". It contains
    explicitly all covalent bonds (in CONECT records).

    To verify that the algorithm used in 3DNA is rigorous and
    reversible, re-analyze the rebuilt structure "temp.pdb", and you
    will get the same base-pair parameters as directly from
    "355d.pdb". Alternatively, you could superimpose "temp.pdb" to
    "355d.pdb", and the RMSD is virtually zero if only base atoms
    (i.e., excluding backbone) are considered. If the approximate
    sugar-phosphate backbone atoms (full-atom) are also used in the
    superposition, the results for the three DNA structures are as
    follows:
 
                                     1aoi   355d   2d94
                      full-atom       0.82     0.73     0.52
                      base-atom       0.05     0.02     0.03

    In rebuilding full-atomic models, regular sugar-phosphate backbone
    conformations were used: B-type for 1aoi and 355d, and A-type
    for 2d94.
