File "stacking.pdb" is from the analysis of the 1.4 A resolution
structure (CGCGAATTCGCG)2 solved by Shui et al. (bdl084/355d). The 11
base-stacking diagrams in color EPS format were generated using the
following command:
         find_pair bdl084.pdb stdout | analyze stdin
         mstack2img '-tlcdo -s=25' stacking.pdb 1 11 bdl084_

"mstack2img" (in directory $X3DNA/perl_scripts as of 3DNA v2.1) is a
short Perl script which calls "stack2img" to do the job.

Option -c means color figure. By default, A is rendered red, T blue, G green
          and C yellow, following the NDB convention
       -d draws hydrogen bonds
       -t means "normal top view", with long base-pair axis horizontal
       -l label each base with chain ID and residue number
       -o means filled the base rings
            these one-letter options can be in either case, any order
            and/or combined
       -s=25 sets the scale factor so that all generated figures are 
           on the same scale

If you would like only a single structure, simply change "1 11" above
to "n n", where "n" is an integer between 1 and 11, say 5.

Alternatively, run the following commands:

ex_str -5 stacking.pdb step5.pdb
stack2img -cdo -s=25 step5.pdb step5.ps

That is, use the utility program "ex_str" to extract the desired
dinucleotide step to a file, then run "stack2img" to get the EPS file.
