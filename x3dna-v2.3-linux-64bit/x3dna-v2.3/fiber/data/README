           THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURES OF NUCLEIC ACIDS

     The diskette contains the atomic coordinates of 38 nucleic acid
structures which include DNA, RNA and DNA.RNA hybrids of different
base sequences; single, double, triple and quadruple helices.  These
structures have been determined from detailed fiber diffraction
analyses at Purdue University.  With the exception of Poly d(A).
Poly d(U) (J. Biomol. Struct. Dynamics 1989 6:1203-1215), the files
correspond to contents of Table 2.4.4.2 in Landolt-Bornstein Vol.
VII/1b, pp. 31-170 (Authors: R. Chandrasekaran and S. Arnott).
