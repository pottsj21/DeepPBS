The 'script_h1x_h3y' file has been updated to v2.1, with the following
changes:

  o 'analyze' now requires the input file be specified explicitly, so
      instead of
            find_pair h1.pdb stdout | analyze
      we now have
            find_pair h1.pdb stdout | analyze stdin

  o 'blocview' now generates 'blocview.r3d' instead of 't.r3d'

  o 'x3dna_r3d2png' becomes a sub-command in 'x3dna_utils'.

  o 'my_header.r3d' is copied from $X3DNA/config/my_header_hres.r3d
    for high-resolution 'render'-ing with Raster3D.
