    <h1>Installation</h1>
    <p>The latest 3DNA v2.0, with recipes and associated data files
    for the Nature Protocols manuscript, is distributed in a tarball file named <a href=
    "X3DNA.tar.gz">X3DNA.tar.gz</a>. The tarball link given here is for the reviewing
    process of our 3DNA manuscript: the 3DNA C binaries have been compiled on Ubuntu
    Linux and should run on other flavors of Intel-based Linux distributions. To
    install, download it to a directory of your choice, presumably your home
    directory, and then do the following:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><tt>tar zxvf X3DNA.tar.gz</tt></li>

      <li><tt>cd X3DNA/bin</tt></li>

      <li>
        <tt>x3dna_setup</tt><br />
        It will output message like the following (for my computer settings):
        <pre>
        To run X3DNA, you need to set up the followings:
          o the environment variable X3DNA
          o add $X3DNA/bin to your command line search path
        for your 'bash' shell, please add the following into ~/.bashrc:
          --------------------------------------------------------------
            export X3DNA=/home/xiangjun/X3DNA
            export PATH=/home/xiangjun/X3DNA/bin:$PATH
          --------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
      </li>

      <li>type <tt>find_pair -h</tt> for command line help -- this applies to all
      3DNA binaries. Visit 3DNA homepage at URL <a href="http://3dna.rutgers.edu">http://3dna.rutgers.edu/</a></li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Play with the Recipes</h1>

    <p>The recipes related to the Nature Protocols manuscript is under directory
    <tt>$X3DNA/NP_Recipes</tt> where there is a <a href="README">README file</a>.
    Read it through and check each sub-directory for details.</p>

    <p>In particular, there is a separate directory for each Recipe mentioned in the
    3DNA manuscript that contains all the script(s), data files and the final
    <b>generated image(s) directly used</b> in the manuscript. For verification
    purpose, it would help to firstly make a copy of the directory
    <tt>NP_Recipes</tt> to a new location, e.g., <tt>NP_Recipes_play</tt> (using "<tt>cp
    -r</tt>") and play from there.</p>

    <p>With the software tools mentioned in the next section properly installed,
    re-running the seven Recipe scripts takes less than thirty minutes on my Linux
    box.</p>

    <h1>Links</h1>

    <p>Here is a list of the software mentioned in the manuscript. They are readily
    available and are of great value to our own research. Please note that the software
    listed below are only used in <em>the visualization part of 3DNA</em>, e.g., for
    creating the figures used in the 3DNA manuscript. <b>The analysis and rebuilding
    parts of 3DNA have <em>zero dependence</em> on third-part tools</b>.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><a href="http://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/">RasMol</a> There are many
      variants available, each with claimed new functionality. However, unless well
      tested, some also introduced bugs. Specifically, the v2.7.x series do not
      handle the Alchemy format right. I've been using v2.6.4, the version directly
      from Roger Sayle, the original author of RasMol. While RasMol is <b>not
      directly used</b> in generating the images used in the 3DNA manuscript, it is
      nevertheless a handy <b>light-weighted</b> tool for molecular structure
      visualization, especially for Alchemy files (which PyMOL seems do not
      like).</li>

      <li><a href="http://www.avatar.se/molscript/">MolScript</a> It is used to
      generate Raster3D scenes of protein ribbons and nucleic acid backbone.</li>

      <li><a href="http://skuld.bmsc.washington.edu/raster3d/">Raster3D</a> All 3DNA generated
      raster-graphics images are in Raster3D ".r3d" format. Only <tt>render</tt> is
      used in 3DNA.</li>

      <li><a href="http://pymol.sourceforge.net/">PyMOL</a> While PyMOL is most
      commonly used interactively, we have explored its scripting capability (".pml"
      script) in 3DNA for integration with other command-line driven tools. Of
      course, one can easily load the ".r3d" files into PyMOL to interactively play
      with them, just as with the normal Raster3D/MolSctipt to PyMOL interface.</li>

      <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghostscript/">Ghostscript</a> It
      is used for converting an EPS file to a PNG image at a specific resolution (300
      DPI for the figures in the manuscript).</li>

      <li><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> This
      is a very useful general-purpose image processing toolset. I have been using
      its <tt>display</tt> and <tt>convert</tt> on a regular basis.</li>

      <li><a href="http://www.xfig.org/">Xfig</a> I like Xfig for its simplicity,
      quality, and availability and it fulfills my purposes nicely for line-drawing
      and composing composite figures. In particular, it allows for direct editing of
      the Xfig files generated from 3DNA. In retrospect, 3DNA's support for Xfig was
      added after EPS. Using the utility program <a href=
      "http://www.pstoedit.net/pstoedit">pstoedit</a>, one can easily convert 3DNA
      generated EPS file to Xfig format. However, the more I play with Xfig, the more
      I like it, to the extent that I feel it would benefit 3DNA users by eliminating
      its dependence on a third-party utility program (pstoedit). Of course, if you
      have access to Adobe Illustrator, you can manipulate the EPS file
      directly.</li>
