This directory contains all the scripts (recipes) and associated data files for
the 3DNA Nature Protocols paper.

Please note that to generate the raster graphics images, one needs to have
MolScript, Raster3D, PyMOL, ImageMagick, and Ghostscript installed. Xfig is
useful for editing .fig files generated with 3DNA for touch-up (so is Adobe
Illustrator for the .eps files). RasMol (v2.6.x, NOT v2.7.x) is very useful for
viewing the Alchemy block representation. Please remember to use options
'-alchemy' and '-noconnect'.

Perl script 'extract_np_recipes' is used to extract the recipes listed in the
3DNA Nature Protocols paper. Check source scripts for details.
