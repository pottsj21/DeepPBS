Subject: Re: A question about 3DNA

Hi Sung CHul HA,

Thanks for your message.

I have tried your B-Z junction structure downloaded from the NDB, and
found that the version I gave you works as expected -- 3DNA will detect
the B-Z junction automatically, and give appropriate structure parameters.
In the new release of 3DNA v1.6, I will make this point explicit.

The problem you have with zd0001 is due to the default setting of a
parameter in file misc_3dna.par is a bit too small:

7.5           # max. distance criterion for helix break (FIND_PAIR)
^^^

simply change 7.5 to a larger number, e.g., 9.5, you will get what you
expect.

Have a look at the 3DNA FAQ section for how to made changes to the file
misc_3dna.par for local or global effects.

HTH,

Xiangjun
