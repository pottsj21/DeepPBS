Dear SungChul Ha,

Nice to hear from you. Have you run the updated 3DNA program from the URL
I provided in my previous email? I would expect that the local base
parameters from the revised program should be the same as you would
analyze B- and Z-part *separately*, i.e., the new program (with -n option)
should handle a structure with B/Z junction automatically. Could you
please verify this?

I am glad that you raised the Rise discrepancy, 2.6A from 3DNA vs. 3.82 A
in O. I am not sure exactly how Rise is caluclated in O, but this Rise
discrepancy is clearly related to relatively large buckles, in opposite
sense, in the two bps. This is documented in the standard reference frame
report (Olson et al., J. Mol. Biol. 313(1), 229-237, 2001), and I have
generated a GIF image to illustrate this point at URL:
    http://rutchem.rutgers.edu/~xiangjun/3DNA/temp/

Since SCHNAaP/CEHS (FreeHelix/NewHelix as well) is based on RC8-YC6 middle 
point in defining the bp origin, one would expect a much larger rise in 
such cases. This is indeed the case, as shown in the output file from the 
"cehs" program (I have just updated it and put it on the above URL): The 
Rise is now 3.72 A, close to 3.82 A as you got from O.
    step       Shift     Slide      Rise      Tilt      Roll     Twist
   1 CT/AG      1.88      1.00      3.72      3.59     -8.64    -14.19

The point here is not the numerical value per se, but what does it mean.  
In this regard, one would find the stacking diagram and side view image
given in the about URL helpful. Both of them are conveniently generated
with 3DNA.

Hope this helps.

Xiang-Jun

PS. If you run the updated 3DNA, do not forget to use -n option for 
    programs "analyze" and "cehs".
